<center><p>The following tools are helpful for carving!</p></center>
<center><p>Learn how to create them!</p></center>
<hr />
<center><p>Handaxe</p></center>
<p>Needed Materials: Medium-sized rock (preferably Flint), smaller rock</p>
<p>*Take the smaller rock, and using it, tactfully strike the larger rock's edges.</p>
<p>*Go all the way around the large rock, until all the edges are exposed.</p>
<p>*Sharpen one of the edges of the large rock by shaving it down using the smaller rock.</p>
<p>(Make sure that the entire rock is not sharp, so that you are still able to use it without injuring yourself!)</p>
<p>Once you have sharpened one edge of the rock, you have created your handaxe! Use for any of your carving needs!</p>
<hr />
<center><p>Chisel</p></center>
<p>Needed Materials: Large rock, small rock (preferably Flint), water, clay</p>
<p>*Place the large rock on a flat surface.<p>
<p>*Scrape the small rock against the large one, shaving down the small rock until all of the inner material is exposed.</p>
<p>Mix water and clay together.</p>
<p>Pour the mixture on top of the large rock.</p>
<p>Continue scraping the small rock against the large rock, now in the mixture.</p>
<p>(Make sure to only do the top part of the rock!)</p>
<p>Keep doing this until the top part of the rock is completely smooth and thin</p>
<p>Once you have done this, you have created your chisel! Use for all of your carving needs!</p>
