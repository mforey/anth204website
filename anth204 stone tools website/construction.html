<center><p>The following tools are helpful for constructing!</p></center>
<center><p>Learn how to create them!</p></center>
<hr />
<center><p>Hammer</p></center>
<p>Needed Materials: Thick and rectangular rock, sharp and small rock (preferably flint), thick stick of wood, large rock</p>
<p>*Place the thick, rectangular rock on a flat surface.</p>
<p>*On the top of the rock, attempt to make a hole in the middle by shaving the middle down with the small and sharp rock.</p>
<p>*Once you have created a hole that goes through the rock, place the large rock on a flat surface.</p>
<p>*Shave the rock with the hole on the large rock, smoothing out the rough edges.</p>
<p>*Once you have done that, shave the top of the thick stick of wood so that it fits into the hole of the rock.</p>
<p>*Insert the stick into the rock's hole. Make sure it is secure!</p>
<p>*Once you have done that, you have created your hammer! Use it for any of your construction needs!</p>
<hr />
<center><p>Saw</p></center>
<p>Needed Materials: Flake of flint, small rock</p>
<p>*Using the small rock, straighten and thin out one of the edges of the flake of flint, making it sharp.</p>
<p>*Once you have sharpened the side of the flint, make jagged edges on it (like a saw) using the small rock.</p>
<p>(Make sure the edges are subtle, so that it is not too hard to use.)</p>
<p>*Once you have done that, you have created your saw! Use it for all of your construction needs!</p>
