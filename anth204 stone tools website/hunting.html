<center><p>The following tools are helpful for hunting!</p></center>
<center><p>Learn how to create them!</p></center>
<hr />
<center><p>Spear</p></center>
<p>Needed Materials: Long rock (preferable flint), large rock, small rock, water, clay</p>
<p>*Using the smaller rock, shave off the edges of the long rock until all the edges are exposed.</p>
<p>*Place the large rock on a flat surface.</p>
<p>*Shave the long rock against the large rock, sharpening it as much as possible.</p>
<p>*Use the smaller rock to assist in shaving down if needed.</p>
<p>*Mix water and clay together.</p>
<p>*Pour the mixture on top of the large rock.</p>
<p>*Scrape and sharpen the long rock against the large rock, now in the mixture.</p>
<p>*Once the rock is smooth and sharp, you have created your spear! Use it for all of your hunting needs!</p>
<hr />
<center><p>Arrowhead</p></center>
<p>Needed Materials: Small rock (preferably flint), large rock, water, clay</p>
<p>*Place the large rock on a flat surface.</p>
<p>*Shave the small rock against the large rock, until all of the small rock is exposed.</p>
<p>*Mix water and clay together.</p>
<p>*Pour the mixture on top of the large rock.</p>
<p>*Scrape and sharpen the top of the small rock against the large rock, now in the mixture.</p>
<p>*Make sure you created a sharp and thin point from the top of the rock. It should be able to pierce if thrown from a distance.</p>
<p>*Once you have made a sharp point, you have created your arrowhead! Use it for all of your hunting needs!</p>
<p>(If you would like, you can attach the arrowhead to the top of a sturdy stick to create an arrow!)</p>
